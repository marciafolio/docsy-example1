The FOLIO LSP includes the domains that support the libraryâ€™s operations such as circulation, acquisitions, cataloging and e-resources management. Each domain is comprised of multiple, smaller apps (for example a check-in or checkout app within the circulation domain). Features include the ability, for example, to:

* Manage the library inventory including cataloging and bibliographic management functions
* Manage vendors, budgets, orders and invoicing when acquiring materials
* Manage electronic resources including holdings, licenses and agreements
* Manage users including library staff, faculty and students
* Support different patron types, loan types, fines and fees structures, recalls, and holds, as well as reporting functions
* Circulate items and define circulation rules including loan, fines, notices and requests policies
* Manage data import and export
