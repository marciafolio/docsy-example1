FOLIO is an open source Library Services Platform (LSP). The platform supports core functionality for the management of print and electronic resources. Built natively for the cloud, FOLIO uses a modern microservices architecture to allow a choice of applications. In this manner, FOLIO moves beyond the traditional library system, allowing anyone to freely build on the platformâ€™s core functionality or to extend it through the development of applications that deliver new services.
