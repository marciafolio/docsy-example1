### Working with open loans

//Open loans are listed here. If you click the number of open items, it opens a list which defaults to Open Loans.  The number of records found is displayed. The display defaults to display all available information.  You can customize which columns are displayed.

**To customize which columns are displayed:**

1. Click **Select Columns**.  The list of columns is displayed.
2. Check or uncheck boxes to select the desired columns to display. The display adjusts accordingly.
3. Click outside the box to close the list of options.
