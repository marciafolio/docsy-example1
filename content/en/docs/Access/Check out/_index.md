The Check Out app enables a patron to use an item.  To check out an item, first locate the patron in the system and then scan the item.

## Locating the patron in the system

You can find the patron by either:

* Scanning or entering the barcode provided by the patron
* Using the Patron Look-up function

**To look up a patron:**

1. In the Scan Patron Card area, click **Patron Look-up**. A Select User screen appears.
2. Enter part or all of the patron's name.
3. (Optional) Filter results by status (active/inactive), or by patron type.
4. Click **Search**.
5. Click the patron to use. The Select User screen closes and the barcode appears in the Scan Patron Card area.

Once you have entered the patron barcode in the Scan Patron Card area, click Enter to display details about the borrower.  Note that you can click the patron's name or barcode to open additional information within the Users app.  

Review the information available to determine if you can continue with check out.  For example, fees or fines may be owed, and may need to be handled before proceeding.  

## Scanning the item to check out

**To select the item for check out:**

Scan or enter the barcode of the item and click Enter.  The item is displayed in the Scan Items area and the number of items scanned is incremented.  

**To sort the list of items to check out:**

You can change the order of the list by clicking the arrow next to the "No." column.

## Ending the check out session

Once you have completed checking out items for a patron, you can end the session.

**To end the check out session:**

* In the Scan Items area, click the End Session button at the top right or bottom right of the screen.  The session is then complete.
